Welcome.

I've started developing Android apps for fun back in 2013. Hobby became job in 2015. Successfully developed and shipped more than 5 applications. Worked alone, in small teams and for tech giants. Currently working for Sberbank Technologies as Android Software Engineer.

I prefer talking and dealing with Java, Kotlin and Android. Love reactive programming, Android performance talks, microservices and new languages like Kotlin and Dart.
